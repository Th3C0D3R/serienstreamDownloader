## This nodeJS app downloads entire seasons from SerienStream.to 

## STILL WIP AND ACTIVE!

Either run `node app.js` as a express server and call `127.0.0.1:3000/downloadSeason?url={seasonurl}&title={title}` in your browser to start the download (without any visual info, FOR NOW, so WIP)

OR

run `node index.js` with both parameters, like: `node index.js "{url}" "{title}"` and have console output.


ITS STILL WIP and for educational purposes only
